# Flask app for summarizing news articles
This project scrapes news articles from [The Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/) and produces a summary of information from the articles, which includes the date published, date updated, title, author, geographical entities and summarized content. 

The motivation of this project was to experiment with text summarization using Hugging Face Transformers - [BART](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/bart) and model deployment using Flask.
